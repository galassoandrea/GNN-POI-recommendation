# GNN-POI-recommendation
This is an academic project for my Deep Learning exam.
The work consists in a colab notebook, in which I've implemented, trained and tested a Graph Neural Network model for the task of POI recommendation.
More into the details, the specific type of GNN implemented is a GCN (Graph Convolutional Network), with different types of layers.
I also used a pretrained SentenceBert model to compute meaningful embeddings for several textual features.
The trained model can be used both to recommend a single POI and an itinerary of POIs.
All the information about loading and preprocessing of the data, feauture engineering, training, validation, test and inference are described in depth inside the notebook.
